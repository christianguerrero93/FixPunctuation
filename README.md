# FixPunctuation

The program asks for the names of both an input file and an output file. The program checks the text file for several formatting and punctuation rules shown below.

1.	Any string of two or more blank characters is replaced by a single blank.
2.	All sentences start with an uppercase letter. All sentences after the first one begin after either a period, a question mark, or an exclamation mark that is followed by one or more whitespace characters.
